## **What are Design Patterns?**

Design Patterns are our current best guess for some common problems in software development. An example would be: the pedestrian traffic problem or ‚Äúhow can I manage pedestrian traffic in a city?‚Äù, urbanist-architects have a current best guess to solve it ‚Äî‚Ääthe sidewalk. That‚Äôs what we could consider to be a Design Pattern.

## **What does it take to be a Design Pattern?**

<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>Needs to solve a problem</li>
    <li>Needs to be a proven solution (It has been used before in many contexts and worked)</li>
    <li>Needs to be reusable</li>
    <li>It can‚Äôt be obvious. For example, assigning a value to a variable to store it can‚Äôt be considered a Design Pattern</li>
    <li>Needs human intervention to be adapted to a certain context</li>
</ol>

## **Why use Design Patterns?**

<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>Makes communication between developers easier by creating a common vocabulary</li>
    <li>Makes the developing process easier by providing reusable solutions for common problems</li>
</ol>

## **What are some Design Patterns' types?**

<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>Creational: solves problems related to creating new instances and objects</li>
    <li>Structural: solves problems related to having a relationship with an object ‚Äî either extends or simplifies an object</li>
    <li>Behavioral: solves problems related to cooperation between objects ‚Äî how they manage responsibilities and communication sticking to good design</li>
</ol>

## **What are Creational Patterns examples?**

<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>Factory: solves the problem of creating multiple similar objects</li>
    <li>Singleton: solves the problem of assuring it will be only one instance of an object</li>
    <li>Module: solves the problem of organizing methods. Works like a toolbox ‚Äî grouping similar methods</li>
</ol>

## **What are Structural Patterns examples?**

<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>Decorator: solves the problem of extending an object's functionality while protecting current behavior.</li>
    <li>Fa√ßade: solves the problem of simplifying interaction with an object.</li>
    <li>Flyweight: solves the problem of reducing memory footprint on application context through sharing data between similar objects</li>
</ol>

## **What are Behavioural Patterns examples?**

<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>Observer: solves the problem of notifying multiple objects when an event happens</li>
    <li>Mediator: solves the problem of communication between objects while maintaining them decoupled</li>
    <li>Command: solves the problem of tracking an object's execution history. Also makes implementation more solid, decoupling it from execution</li>
</ol>

## **Conclusion**

This article only touches the tip of the iceberg concerning Design Patterns discussions. There is even a totally different type not approach here: Concurrency Patterns. To know more follow the links below or start your own journey üöÄ.
